=====

A tool to generate Gentoo ebuilds from various sources

Named after the alien tool from Debian.

GOAL
====

The goal of this project is to create a tool that can be used to easily create Gentoo ebuilds from various sources.

Milestone 1: Web-based ebuild generation
----------------------------------------
sourceforge.net, the Debian project all have rather well-known web sites which can be used to extract information about their hosted software.

elien should use this information to fill in the metadata bits in an ebuild

Milestone 2: handle different build and install systems
-------------------------------------------------------
Primarily should fill in ebuild inherit and build info

Milestone 3: true alien
-----------------------

Where available, build info from other packages should be converted to ebuilds.

	Examples: .deb build
              .rpm .spec files
			  Arch AUR/PKGBUILD files
